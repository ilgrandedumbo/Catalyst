## 1. Title

The title is designed to immediately express the project’s mission: “(Re)cycle and (Thrift) your items.”  
> The name is temporary and may change as the project evolves.

## 2. The Problem We’re Tackling

Modern cities face an ever-growing challenge: urban waste management. Items still in good condition often end up in dumpsters, while citizens lack strong incentives to recycle and reuse.  
In many cities, beyond a basic waste collection fee, an additional tax is charged based on the quantity of waste produced. This has fueled a rise in illegally abandoned black garbage bags on the streets.  
The result: more waste, greater environmental impact, and communities losing access to goods that could still be useful.  

Our solution is to create an **ecosystem** that combines the idea of a **Thrift Store** with the logic of **Incentivized Recycling**, turning a duty into a rewarding, sustainable, and socially enriching experience.

## 3. Our Goals

1. Reduce urban waste by either promoting proper disposal or giving items a second life.  
2. Motivate citizens through a points-based system, allowing them to purchase goods from others or redeem rewards of various kinds (inspired by [Microsoft Rewards](https://rewards.bing.com)).  
3. Encourage sharing by fostering exchange and solidarity among community members.  
4. Educate on recycling, making sustainability a natural habit rather than a forced obligation.  

## 4. Target Audience

Our potential audience includes:  
- Families seeking to cut waste and expenses.  
- People with items that are no longer useful to them but still functional.  
- Environmentally conscious citizens.  
- Young people curious about circular consumption and social experiences.  
- Individuals looking for unique or rare items.  
- People dissatisfied with paying extra based on the volume of their waste.  
- Anyone simply waiting for the right motivation to start recycling.  

## 5. Key Features

1. **Circular Marketplace**  
   A platform to buy and sell reusable items, searchable by category or condition.  

2. **Incentive System**  
   A virtual currency (points) that can be redeemed as gift cards, used for purchases, or transferred to other users in exchange for items.  

3. **Incentivized Recycling**  
   Partnerships with recycling centers and collection facilities. Users receive a digital receipt to certify completed recycling.  

4. **Community & Gamification**  
   Leaderboards, badges, and monthly challenges to earn bonus points. Swap events encourage real-world social interaction.  

5. **Interactive Map**  
   A user-friendly map to locate recycling points or connect with other users for exchanges.  

## 6. Benefits

- Lower ecological footprint and less urban waste.  
- Savings for citizens and opportunities for partner companies.  
- Stronger community bonds through shared participation.  
- A more active and positive perception of change.
